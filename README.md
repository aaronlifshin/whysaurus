Basic Setup Instructions:

1. Clone
2. Get constants.py from a collaborator and put it in this directory
3. Get the [Google App Engine SDK/Launcher for Python](https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads)
4. pip install -t lib django
5. `bin/compilelessc.sh` -- for Windows try [WinLESS](http://www.winless.org), and only compile the files listed in bin/compilelessc.sh, and set their output (by right clicking on the files) to /static/css.
   For MAC we have used SimpLESS, but have needed to apply this patch: https://gist.github.com/hlop/4951717
   For Linux just run `npm install -g less`
6. `bin/run.sh` or run in the Google App Engine Launcher and set to port 8081
