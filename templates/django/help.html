<h4>What Is Whysaurus?</h4>    
<p><strong>Whysaurus</strong> is an intuitive platform for building evidence-based arguments. It is also free, collaborative and open-source.<br>
<br>
The problem we’re addressing is that argument doesn’t work well on the internet: the structure of forums and comment threads naturally lend themselves to vitriol and incoherence. This is bad for users and bad for society. Thoughtful, evidence-based argument is how we collectively figure out answers to difficult problems.<br>
<br>
So we are creating tools to make productive argument easier, for schools and the internet broadly, and improve the way we - the public - debate important questions facing our society.</p>

<h4>How Does it Work?</h4>                
<strong>Whysaurus is made of claims</strong>
<p>Whysaurus helps you explain ideas by dividing them into bite-size claims. 
Each claim can be supported or countered by other claims, as well as rated and commented.</p>

<strong>Claims are reusable</strong>
<p>  When you create a good explanation, others can use 
it to support or counter another Whysaurus claim.  
When adding a supporting or counter claim, you can search the system to see what's 
already out there.</p>

<strong>Creation is collaborative</strong>
<p>Users create and refine claims together, to arrive 
at the best explanation over time. Any user can edit any claim, and all work is saved in 
the history, so that it is never lost and can be recovered.</p>

<strong>A repository of explanations</strong>
<p>Over time, we hope that Whysaurus will collect convincing arguments for positions and opinions on many subjects.  
Together, we can create a reference repository of the best explanations accessible to all.
</p>

<h4>What is your Mission?</h4>
<p>Whysaurus seeks to connect people who are passionate about reason, 
    to create tools for illustrating the relationships between ideas, 
    to share the world's best explanations and to help us all to organize our thoughts. 
    For more about what we believe, check out our <a href="https://www.whysaurus.com/manifesto" target="_blank">Manifesto</a>
</p>

<h4>What can I use Whysaurus for?</h4>
<strong>Collaborate</strong>
<p>When working with a team, the Whysaurus format allows for collaboration: edit as a team, 
vote on what works and what doesn't, and reuse already completed work by linking it into your tree.</p>

<strong>Make Decisions</strong>
<p>Whysaurus can be used to decide a difficult question by building one explanation 
for the pros and another for the cons.  When you present your recommendations to a 
decision-maker, they can navigate the tree and see the reasoning behind your explanation.</p>

<strong>Explain complex concepts</strong>
<p>Whether you are looking to consider great philosophical questions or the latest political conundrum, a 
Whysaurus claim can help simplify, clarify and get to the heart of the matter. </p>

<strong>Publish your opinion</strong>
<p>The internet is moving away from the essay or article format.  
Why not illustrate  your thesis as a tree of Whysaurus claims?  
There is no tl;dr, your readers can focus on the claim in your argument that 
is most of interest, and can help improve it.</p>

<strong>Make a convincing argument</strong>
<p>Sometimes you just need to argue on the internet.  You may want to convince your
friends or a recalcitrant family member of an idea you believe in.  
With Whysaurus, your explanation remains online to be reused, and can 
be refined and added to by others.</p>

<h4 id="PointStrengthLink">How can I make Whysaurus better?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Voice your opinion on claims by clicking agree or disagree</li>
<!--<li>Award ribbons to claims that you believe are well-made</li>-->
<li>Make your own claims</li>
<li>Edit claims made by others if you see ways to make them better</li>
<li>Recommend Whysaurus to your friends</li>
<li><a href="contact" target="_blank">Send us a suggestion</a> for improving the site</li>
<li>Contribute code - Whysaurus is open-source. If you're interested, let us know.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="WhatMakesAPointStrong">What makes a claim strong?</h4>
<ul>
<li>A strong claim is specific, concise and connected to a set of strong 
supporting claims, thus making it convincing.</li>
<li>A strong claim is supported by linked sources.</li>
<li>A strong claim is, if possible, a standalone statement, phrased to be understood in any context</li>
</ul>

<h4>What makes a claim weak?</h4>
A claim can be weak for a variety of reasons. It might be:
<ul>
<li>Vague or unclear without further explanation </li>
<li>Based on insufficient or irrelevant supporting claims </li>
<li>Not supported by sources</li>
</ul>
<!--
<h4>Opinions and Subjective Claims</h4>
Whysaurus can be used to illustrate opinions and subjective ideas. The key is to make sure that you create a sufficient body of supporting claims to prove your idea.
-->
<h4>How is Whysaurus different than Wikipedia?</h4>
Wikipedia collects facts and Whysaurus is designed for opinions and topics of debate - grey areas where it's unclear what is true and what isn't. By breaking complex ideas down into a series of bite-size claims, Whysaurus helps us navigate the murky waters of uncertainty.

<h4>What's up with with dinosaurs?</h4>
Dinosaurs are awesome. 



<h2 id="nutsAndBolts">Nuts and Bolts</h2>

<h4 id="scoringAlgorithm">How is a claim's score calculated?</h4>
<p>The factors that influence the score of a claim are:
<ul> 
<li>Agrees</li>
<li>Disagrees</li>
<li>Sources</li>
<li>Scores of Evidence claims, multiplied by their Relevance</li>
</ul>
eg, A +10 Supporting Claim with 50% Relevance contributes +5 (+10 * 50%) to the claim above it. If it were a Counter Claim, then it would contribute -5.<br/>
<br/>
The scoring algorithm is a work-in-progress. Currently the algorithm only “looks” one level down. In the future, it may be possible to defend a point’s score by attacking its counter points.
</p>

<h4>Why is there a Relevance rating in addition to Agree/Disagree?</h4>
Relevance score allows us to find the most important ideas quickly and easy.
For example, if the claim "The Earth's atmosphere is getting warmer" were supported by "It snows often in Finland",
we might agree with both claims, but mark this particular link with a low relevance.<br/><br/>

Every link between two claims has a unique relevance score.

<h4>How are claims sorted?</h4>
<p>By relevance.</p>

<!--
<h4>How is the color of the score determined?</h4>
The color is based solely on the value of the score; it allows the value of a group of claims to be surmised at a glance. 
The color system is based on the traffic light: green is strong and red is weak. 
The current thresholds are:The current thresholds are:<br>
<br>
3 and higher = <span class="greenScore">green</span><br>
-2 to 2 = <span class="yellowScore">yellow</span><br>
-3 and lower = <span class="redScore">red</span><br>
<br>
Whysaurus is a work-in-progress, so expect these thresholds to change as we improve the site. 
This means that the score colors of claims may change occasionally as we experiment.
-->
<h4>Can a claim be part of multiple explanations?</h4>
Yes! For example, a claim about wind might feature in one explanation about kites, one about weather and another about sailboats. 

<h4>Why are there limits on the length of the titles of claims?</h4>
Shorter claim titles are easier to understand. Also, it's easier to identify strengths (and weaknesses) in an explanation that is 
divided into many bite-sized claims. Short titles can also be shared on twitter without getting truncated. 
If your title doesn't fit inside the limit, consider dividing the idea into several smaller claims, or just put 
some of the text you had in mind into the body of the claim. 

<h4>Is it possible to unlink or disconnect a Supporting or Counter Claim</h4>
Yes. There is a control do this at the bottom of the Relevance widget, which you can get to by clicking on the "Relevance" tab of
any Supporting or Counter Claim.

<!--
<h4>Why do you have two rating systems - agree/disagree and the blue ribbons?</h4>
Whether or not one agrees with a claim and whether or not a claim is well-made are two different questions. 
A user who can disagree with a claim while also awarding it a blue-ribbon embodies the spirit we hope to foster on Whysaurus.

<h2 id="best">Best Practices</a></h2>
<h4>Goals for this section</h4>
This goal of this section is to collect guidelines for how Whysaurus can be used most effectively. 
It is a work-in-progress. If you have a suggestion for how to improve this page we'd love to hear it! 
Leave us a note <a href="contact" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h4>Try to keep each claim as simple as you can</h4>
A great way to explain a complex idea is to divide it into a series of easily digestible bits. If your claim is complex, see if you can divide it into a group of simpler claims supporting each other.

<h4>Try to write claims so that they can be used in multiple explanations</h4>
One of the fun things about Whysaurus is how it allows us to see how some fundamental thoughts are part of many different big ideas. 
If your claim is written so that it can "stand alone" - that is it doesn't require the context 
of other claims in order to be understood - then other users will be more likely to link to it in their own explanations. 

<h4>Note your sources (and illustrate them!)</h4>
Readers are more likely to agree with your claim if it has good sources. Sources can be books, papers, studies or other websites.

<h4>Be Specific</h4>
<p>Try to make your claims and your comments as specific as possible. Whether you agree or disagree, always tells us WHY.</p>
<!--
For example, rather than writing<br>
<em>This claim goes overboard</em><br>
instead try:<br>
<em>This claim is overreaching. It might true in some cases, but there is not enough evidence in the supporting claims 
to prove that the statement is true all of the time.</em>
-->
<h2 id="best">Community rules</a></h2>

<h4>Tone</h4>
Whysaurus is a civil community. Please act respectfully and do your best to make the claims you encounter stronger.

<h4>Commenting: Always comment on content, not people</h4>
Critical comments should always critique a Whysaurus claim but never a Whysaurus user. Comments that break this rule will be removed.

<h4>Contest semantics only when intent is truly unclear</h4>
When a grammatical error or hasty choice of words prevents a clear interpretation of a claim's intent, work together with your fellow users to iron that out. But if the intent of a claim can be understood, there's no need to call in the semantics police.
